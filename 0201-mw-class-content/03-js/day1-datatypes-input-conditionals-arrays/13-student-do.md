Part One

- make a list of 5 of your favorite bands/musicians and put it inside of an array and store that into a variable called myFavoriteMusicalArtists

- ask the user for a band/artist, turn the user input lower case (use the ) and then tell the user if the band is inside your myFavoriteMusicalArtists array or not. Which means you like the same band the user does too! 

Part Two

```
// ### Array Manipulation - 20 minutes

var gameboy = [ 'Game Boy', 'nintendo', 149.99 ];
var pokemon = [ 'Pokemon Blue', 'nintendo', 49.99 ];
var tetris = [ 'Tetris', 'SEGA', 49.99 ];

// How would you:

// Without touching the above code:
// * Change the name of the gameboy to be `Game Boy Color`.
// * Change the company of the pokemon game to be capitalized.
// * Remove the price of Tetris and store it in a variable oldPrice, then put in a new price 9000.99 into the tetris array.
// * Set the company of the tetris array to Nintendo instead of SEGA
