PART ONE:

```
var coolPeople = ['bruce lee', 'arnold schwarzenegger', 'will smith', 'esther', 'marie curie', 'joan of arc'];

//console.log out each part of the coolPeople array
```

PART TWO:

```
// make an array of drinks with all capitals
// modify each part of the array of drinks and make each item lowercased - DO NOT DIRECTLY EDIT THE INSIDE OF THE ARRAY! 
```


BONUS ONE:
```
1. Create a new variable called cart. Add the gameboy, pokemon, and tetris arrays into the cart array.

// How would you:

// Access the name of the pokemon game through the cart variable.
// Access the price of the tetris game.
// Change the price of the tetris game to be 9012.
// Change the name of the Game Boy in the cart to Game Boy Advance.

var gameboy = [ 'Game Boy', 'nintendo', 149.99 ];
var pokemon = [ 'Pokemon Blue', 'nintendo', 49.99 ];
var tetris = [ 'Tetris', 'SEGA', 49.99 ];
```

BONUS TWO:
* Look at the original variables and look at the values stored in the cart array.
* Did changing the array values in the cart array affect the values of the original arrays?
* Why?
