Part One
1. Explain the below code to your partner
2. Why did we have a \ in what\'s your # below?
3. Why did we start the first for loop with i=1 instead of i=0?
4. Why did we start the second for loop with i=0 instead of i=1?

Part Two
add a break point inside of both for loops, execute the code and everytime the browser stops, check the value of favTVshows

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>exercise one</title>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
//initialize array
var favTVshows = [];

//for loop 
for (var i=1; i<4; i++){
	favTVshows.push(prompt('what\'s your #' + i + ' favorite tv show?'));
}

for(var i=0; i < favTVshows.length; i++){
	alert(favTVshows[i]);
}

</script>
</body>
</html>


```
