### Week 11.1 Exercise 3

In class there was a ```node_modules``` folder, I've deleted it when pushing up the code.  If you remember, when we used ```npm install prompt --save```, it added a dependency in our ```package.json``` file.

From this point, after you've cloned the repo and you're in this folder, you can run ```npm install```, and it will create a ```node_modules``` folder for you, which will include some preset modules as well as ```prompt```.

Once you've run that command to install the dependency, you can node try running ```node constructorFun.js```, to execute to the code.
