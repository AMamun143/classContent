### 1. Partners do (20 minutes)
```
Part one:
---------
Make a dog object with two keys.

One key called sleepy = false;

Second key called noise = 'woof';

Third key called makeNoise which console.logs the noise to the screen if the dog is not sleepy.

Part two:
---------
Make a cat object with two keys.

One key called sleepy = true;

Second key called noise = 'meow';

Third key called makeNoise which console.logs the noise to the screen if the cat is not sleepy.

Part Three:
-----------
make the dog bark

make the cat meow

Part Four:
-----------
Why are parts one and two redundant? What are ways we can write dry code?

```
Make a Tamagotchi constructor. Give it the following properties:
1. a hungry property (initially false)
2. a sick property (initially false)
3. an age of 0

and give it the following methods:

feed() - if hungry is true, print "That was yummy!" and set hungry to false. If hungry is false, print "No thanks, I'm full." and set hungry to true.
sleep() - prints out "zzzzzzz" (use as many z's as you want) and then set hungry to true.
medicate() - if sick is true, print "I feel much better!" and set sick to false. If sick is false, print "No thanks, I feel fine." and set sick to true.
increaseAge() - increase the age by one and print "Happy Birthday to me! I am " + age + " years old!"
Now make a variable named dog that is set to a new Tamagotchi.

Add the following methods to it:
1. bark() - prints out "ruff ruff
2. goOutside() - prints out "I own that tree now!"

Make a variable named cat that is set to a new Tamagotchi. Add the following methods to it:
1. meow() - prints out "Meow!"
2. scratchThatChair() - "Stop scratching that chair!!!"
```

### 12. Partners do (20 minutes)
```
1. In a new folder
2. make a new node file called constructorFun.js
3. auto create a package.json file with npm init
4. install the prompt package so that it's
5. Inside constructorFun.js, make a constructor function called Student that creates a student object with properties of name, gender, grade, GPA, detentions, sleepingInClass, catchPhrase, and a function called canStudentHaveFun that checks if they have less than 10 detentions and above a 2 GPA. If they do then console.log out to the terminal that the student can have fun.
6. Prompt the user for a student's information, make a new Student Object with it, then invoke the canStudentHaveFun function.
```
