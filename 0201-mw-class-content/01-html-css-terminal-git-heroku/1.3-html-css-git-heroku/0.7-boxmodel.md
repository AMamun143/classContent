+ CSS Box Model

*refer to this while reading this: css-box-model-visual.html*

> The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
    
+ Padding, margins, borders

> Writing shorthand for margin and padding is clockwise (top, right, bottom, left e.g. `padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px`). 

> If there are only 3 values, then the last value (left), assumes the same value as the right side. 

> If there are 2 values, the first two apply to top and bottom, the second two apply to left and right. 

> If there is only one value, it applies to all sides. 

> Or you can write just one side at a time like `padding-right: 20px`
