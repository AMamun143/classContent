IN HTML

	`<div class="firstClass secondClass thirdClass">`

in jQuery if you were creating a div and adding classes to it

	to a new element that doesn't exist on the page yet
		`var b = $('<div class="firstclass secondClass thirdClass">');`

	to an element that already exists on the page
		`$('#body').addClass('firstClass secondClass thirdClass');`
